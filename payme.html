                    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                    <p>I designed the PayMe payment app end-to-end, based on a gap in the fintech industry
                        I discovered during market research. The result is an engaging, human-centered design solution
                        focused on
                        ease of use, transparency, and customizable automation to achieve both, user and business goals.

                <h2>Context</h2>
                <p>Payme is a web-based payment platform start-up supporting users with in-store & online payments,
                    peer-to-peer money transfers, savings automation, and customizable tracking & budgeting features.

                        <h4>The Problem</h4>
                        <p>Users do not have access to a single financial solution providing a secure, and simple way to
                            transact with others while offering automated savings and personalized financial management
                            tools to establish and maintain financial health.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>Why it's Important</h4>
                        <p>The Financial Health Pulse 2024 U.S. Trends Report found that 70% of American households are
                            financially unhealthy, reflecting challenges in managing everyday financial
                            responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>My user research findings were congruent with this assessment.</p>

                        However, I suspected subtle gamification would prove useful to those struggling to save money by
                        providing additional perspective in relation to their goals. This was not the case.</p>

                    <p>I built user journeys to unveil additional opportunities to address user pain points for each

                        users via card sorting exercises. Technical issues with recording the first round of the study
                        resulted in having to conduct more studies with new participants. Using AI to aggregate the
                        results from all of the parsed studies was a huge help and got things back on track quickly.</p>

                    <p>Familiar patterns for payments/money-transfers is important for the experience. Novel features
                        need to be equally simple to use and navigate, especially when our goal is to land 1k active
                        users in the first 30 days. Insights have already indicated that ease of use is the primary user
                        concern.</p>

                    <p>I've identified what appear to be the best solutions to minimize cognitive load and move on to
                        iterate in higher fidelity. This stage is essential for me to correctly validate the mapped
                        experience and note opportunities for secondary & tertiary micro-interactions and visuals. Now
                        that I've established loose template standards in the earlier stage, I'm now adding more screens
                        and drilling down on finer details.</p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm relying on the magic of 3. The user should be able to setup and use
                        any feature in 3 simple steps.</p>
                    <p>Typically:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Launch</li>
                        <li>Edit</li>
                        <li>Confirm</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Usability</h3>
                    <p>Every reasonable attempt has been made to focus on user goals while meeting the business
                        objectives of the PayMe organization. From multiple routes to trigger savings and budgeting
                        features to a user-assist acquisition vehicle for referrals, the organization and its product
                        users are poised to meet those goals.</p>

                    <h5>Usability Testing</h5>
                    <p>I conducted another remote usability test of a simulated mobile environment on desktops/laptops
                        with 7 participants varying in age, income, and financial wellness. My goals for this test were
                        to observe and measure not only the usability of the product but also to gather additional data
                        relating to how users intended to incorporate these features into their lives, and the value
                        they felt they were being provided.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>100%</strong> felt the product provides value they can benefit from</li>
                        <li><strong>100%</strong> felt the product was easy to use</li>
                        <li><strong>100%</strong> were delighted by the customization of the product and felt like they
                            had more control in the app compared to competing products</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Beware the 100%s.</strong> Consensus is hardly perfection. There are plenty of chinks to
                        work out.</p>
                    <h5>Usability Insights</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Overall user rating:<strong>7.2</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Need more transparency</strong> before and after in-store transactions</li>
                        <li><strong>More clarity</strong> about how automated savings functions</li>
                        <li><strong>Card selection</strong> is confusing</li>
                    </ul>

                <div>
                    <h3>Transparency & Emotional Design</h3>
                    <p><strong>33%</strong> of participants were concerned with their ability to remember their settings
                        for automated savings at the time of purchase and worried about being surprised by the financial
                        impacts. I flagged this as a potential accessibility issue that needed to be addressed
                        immediately.</p>

                    <p>I also saw this as an opportunity to present users with immediate access to pause automation
                        before
                        individual transactions, providing even more control of their experience.</p>

                    <p>As I progressed through usability testing I also learned that although performance and task
                        completion scores were good, I observed no evidence of an emotional connection with the product
                        itself.</p>

                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>The result is an intuitive, engaging platform for transacting with others while also acruing
                        savings and
                        categorizing transactions for budgeting insights.</p>
                    <p>The UI is clutter-free and will remain as utilitiarian as possible as the product evolves, per

                    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>Work is far from over for the PayMe app, as this is just the foundation for the MVP. I was very
                        surprised by the current comfort level payment app users have with conventional security. I
                        expected to dive deeper into this area from the start, but that was not the case. Moving
                        forward, I suspect additional insights after launch will provide more clarity in regard to
                        tightening up the budgeting feature. I'm expecting big changes for that feature to provide even
                        better utility.</p>

                    <p>This project has been very rewarding, and I enjoyed relying on data to defend my design
                        decisions and push forward to align with the business.</p>
